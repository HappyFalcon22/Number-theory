# Chapter 1 : Basic properties of integers

This chapter discusses some of the fundamental properties of integers, including :
+ Notions of divisibility and primality
+ Unique factorisation into primes
+ GCD (Greatest Common Divisors)
+ LCM (Least Common Multiples)

## Section 1 : Divisibility and primality

<ins> **Divisibility** </ins>

Given $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, we say that ***a divides b*** if $az = b$, for some $z \in \mathbb{Z}$.
There are some notations and results regarding divisibility :
+ We write $a\;\vert\;b$ to denote :
  + ***a divides b*** or ***b is divisible by a*** 
  + ***a is a divisor of b*** or ***b is a multiple of a***
+ We write $a \nmid b$ to denote the opposite case.

<ins> **Theorem 1.1** </ins>

For all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have : 
+ $a \mid a$, $a \mid 0$ and $1 \mid a$
+ $0 \mid a$ if and only if $a = 0$
+ $a \mid b$ if and only if $-a \mid b$ if and only if $a \mid -b$
+ $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$ implies $a \mid (b + c)$
+ $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$ implies $a \mid c$

<ins> **Example** </ins>

+ $3 \mid 6$ because $3.2 = 6$.
+ $3 \mid 9$, $9 \mid 81$ then implies $3 \mid (9 + 81) = 90$
+ $7 \mid 49$, $49 \mid 98$ then implies $7 \mid 98$ ($7.14 = 98$)

<ins> **Theorem 1.2** </ins>

For all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have $a \mid b$ and $b \mid a$ if and only if $a = \pm b$.

<ins> **Primes and composites** </ins>

Let $n$ be a positive integer. if ***only 1 and n divides n***, then $n$ is ***prime***. Otherwise, $n$ is ***composite***.

***Note*** : $1$ is ***neither prime nor composite***

<ins> **Theorem 1.3 (Fundamental theorem of arithmetic)** </ins>

Every non-zero integer can be expressed as : 

$$n = \pm p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}...p_r^{e_r}$$

where $p_1, p_2, ..., p_r$ are ***distinct primes***, and $e_1, e_2, ..., e_r$ are ***positive integers***. Moreover, this expression is ***unique***, up to a reordering of the primes.

<ins> **Example** </ins>

The number $1900544$ can be expressed as :

$$1900544 = 2^{16}.29^1$$

<ins> **Theorem 1.4 (Division with remainder property)** </ins>

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b > 0$. Then there exists unique $q, r \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $a = bq + r$ and $0 \leq r < b$.

Following the definition then :
+ $a$ is the ***dividend***
+ $b$ is the ***divisor***
+ $q$ is the ***quotient***
+ $r$ is the ***remainder***

<ins> **Flooring and ceiling** </ins>

We now look at two basic operators that we use quite a lot on programming. Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ :

+ ***Floor*** (denoted as $\lfloor x \rfloor$) : is the ***unique integer*** $m$ that $m \leq x < m + 1$.
+ **Ceil** (denoted as $\lceil x \rceil$) : is the ***unique integer*** $m$ that $m - 1 < x \leq m$.

<ins> **Example** </ins>

+ $\lfloor 10.392 \rfloor = 10$
+ $\lceil -17.820 \rceil = -17$
+ $\lfloor -0.344 \rfloor = -1$

<ins> **The mod operator** </ins>

We use the ***Theorem 1.4*** to define the ***mod*** operator :

$$a \;mod\; b := r$$

and by theorem, it also means that : $$a = bq + r, q \in \mathbb{Z}$$

<ins> **Exercise takeaways** </ins>

**1.1** : Let $a, b, d \in \mathbb{Z}, d \neq 0$, then $a \mid b$ if and only if $da \mid db$

**1.2** : Let $n$ be a composite integer, there exists a prime $p$ that ***divides n*** and $p \leq \sqrt{n}$

**1.3** : 

**1.4** : Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $2\lfloor x \rfloor \leq \lfloor 2x \rfloor \leq 2 \lfloor x \rfloor + 1$

## Section 2 : Ideals and Greatest Common Divisors

<ins> **Ideals** </ins>

A non-empty set $\mathbb{I} \subset \mathbb{Z}$ is an ***ideal*** if and only if for all $a, b \in \mathbb{I}$ and for all $z \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have :
$$a + b \in \mathbb{I}, az \in \mathbb{I}$$
There are some interesting properties of an ideal based on the definition :
+ Every ideal $\mathbb{I}$ contains $0$
+ Every ideal $\mathbb{I}$ that contains $a$ also contains $-a$
+ Every ideal $\mathbb{I}$ that contains $a, b$ also contains $a - b$
+ $\{0\}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ are ideals
+ An ideal $I$ ***is equal to $\mathbb{Z}$*** if that ideal contains $1$

We will consider a new set : $a\mathbb{Z} := \{az : z \in \mathbb{Z}\}$, which is the ***set of multiples of $a$*** : 
+ If $a = 0$, then the set $a\mathbb{Z} = \{0\}$
+ If $a \neq 0$, then the set $a\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -2a, -a, 0, a, 2a, ...\}$

This set $a\mathbb{Z}$ ***is an ideal generated by a***. And it is also called the ***principal ideal***.

Some of these observation from ideals could be useful and easy to verify :
+ $b \in a\mathbb{Z}$ if and only if $a \mid b$
+ For every ideal $\mathbb{I}$, we have $b \in \mathbb{I}$ if and only if $b\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{I}$

$\Longrightarrow$ $b\mathbb{Z} \subseteq a\mathbb{Z}$ if and only if $a \mid b$
+ If $\mathbb{I_1}$ and $\mathbb{I_2}$ are ideals, then $\mathbb{I} = \mathbb{I_1} + \mathbb{I_2} := \{ a_1 + a_2 : a_1 \in \mathbb{a_1}, a_2 \in \mathbb{I_2} \}$ ***is also an ideal***.

<ins> **Example 1** </ins>

The principal ideal $3\mathbb{Z} = \{ -9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, ... \}$ contains multiples of $3$

<ins> **Example 2** </ins>

The ideal $3\mathbb{Z} + 5\mathbb{Z}$ contains $3.(2) + 5.(-1) = 1$. Therefore, $3\mathbb{Z} + 5\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z}$.

<ins> **Example 3** </ins>

The ideal $4\mathbb{Z} + 6\mathbb{Z}$ contains all even elements in $\mathbb{Z}$ and not contains any odd integers because $4a + 6b$ is always even. Therefore, $4\mathbb{Z} + 6\mathbb{Z} = 2\mathbb{Z}$

<ins> **Theorem 1.6** </ins>

Let $\mathbb{I}$ be the ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$. Then there exists a unique non-negative integer $d$ such that $\mathbb{I} = d\mathbb{Z}$.

<ins> **Greatest Common Divisor** </ins>

For $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, we call $d \in \mathbb{Z}$ a ***common divisor*** of $a$ and $b$ if $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$; moreover, we call such a $d$ a ***greatest common divisor*** of $a$ and $b$ if :
+ $d$ is ***non-negative***.
+ All other common divisors of $a$ and $b$ ***divides d***.

<ins> **Theorem 1.7** </ins>

For all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, there exists a unique greatest common divisor $d$ of $a$ and $b$, moreover $a\mathbb{Z} + b\mathbb{Z} = gcd(a, b)\mathbb{Z} = d\mathbb{Z}$

We denote the greatest common divisor $d$ of $a, b$ as : $d = gcd(a, b)$. We say that $a, b$ are ***relatively prime*** if $gcd(a, b) = 1$.

<ins> **Theorem 1.8 (from Theorem 1.7)** </ins>

Let $a, b, r \in \mathbb{Z}$ and let $d := gcd(a, b)$. Then there exists $s, t \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $as + bt = r$ if and only if $d \mid r$. In particular, $a,b$ are ***relatively prime*** if there exists $s, t \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $as + bt = 1$

<ins> **Proof for Theorem 1.8** </ins>

We have :

$$as + bt = r$$
$$\Longleftrightarrow r \in a\mathbb{Z} + b\mathbb{Z}$$
$$\Longleftrightarrow r \in d\mathbb{Z}$$
$$\Longleftrightarrow d \mid r$$

Note that as definition, we have :
+ $gcd(0, 0) = 0$
+ $gcd(0, a) = gcd(a, 0) = a$

<ins> **Theorem 1.9** </ins>

Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $c \mid ab$ and $gcd(a, c) = 1$. Then $c \mid b$

<ins> **Proof for Theorem 1.9** </ins>

Since $gcd(a,c) = 1$, we have $as + ct = 1$. Multiply two sides by $b$, we have :
$$asb + ctb = b$$
Since $c \mid ab$ from the hypothesis, then $c \mid asb$. Also, $c \mid ctb$, obviously. Therefore, ***c divides the left hand side***, which leads to $c \mid b$.

<ins> **Theorem 1.10** </ins>

Let $p$ be prime, and let $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then $p \mid ab$ implies that $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$.

<ins> **Proof for Theorem 1.10** </ins>

We have $p \mid ab$. If $p \mid a$, then we are done :grinning:. If $p \nmid a$, then $gcd(a, p) = 1$, plus we have $p \mid ab$. Therefore, from ***Theorem 1.9***, $p \mid b$.

<ins> **Exercise Takeaways** </ins>

**1.8** : Let $\mathbb{I}$ be the non-empty set of integers that is closed under additions only. Then if $-a \in \mathbb{I}, \forall a \in \mathbb{I}$, $\mathbb{I}$ is an ideal.

**1.9** : For all integers $a, b, c$, we have :
+ $gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a)$
+ $gcd(a, b) = |a| \Longleftrightarrow a \mid b$
+ $gcd(a, 0) = gcd(a, a) = |a|$ and $gcd(a, 1) = 1$
+ $gcd(ca, cb) = |c|gcd(a, b)$

**1.10** : For all integers $a, b$ with $d = gcd(a, b) \neq 0$, we have : 
$$gcd\left(\dfrac{a}{d}, \dfrac{b}{d}\right) = 1$$

**1.11** : Let $n$ be an integer. If $a, b$ are relatively prime integers, each of which divides $n$, then $ab \mid n$

**1.12** : Two integers are relatively prime, if there is no one prime that can divides both of them

**1.13** : Let $a, b_1, b_2, ..., b_r$ be integers. Then $gcd(a, b_1, b_2, ..., b_r) = 1$ if and only if $gcd(a, b_i) = 1$ for $i = 1,2,...,r$

**1.14** : Let $p$ be prime and $k$ be an integer $(0 < k < p)$. Then the binomial coefficient : 
$$\binom{p}{k} = \dfrac{p!}{k!(p - k)!}$$
is divisible by $p$

**1.15** : An integer $a$ is called ***square-free*** if it is not divisible by by the square of any integer greater than 1. Then we have :
+ $a$ is square-free if and only if $a = \pm p_1p_2...p_r$, where $p_i$'s are distinct primes
+ Every positive integer $n$ can be expressed uniquely as $n = ab^2$, where $a, b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is square-free


## Section 3 : Some consequences of unique factorizations

<ins> **Theorem 1.11** </ins>

There are infinitely many primes

For each prime $p$, we may define the function $\upsilon_p$ that maps ***non-zero integers*** to ***non-negative integers***, as follows : 

> For every integers $n \neq 0$, if $n = p^em$, where $p \nmid m$, then $\upsilon_p(n) := e$

Defining that, we can now write the factorization of $n$ into primes as :

$$n = \pm \prod_p p^{v_p(n)}$$

where the product is over all primes $p$.

At first glance, this is supposed to be an infinite product, but many of its terms are equal to $1$, so this expression still makes sense.

Observe that if $a, b$ are ***non-zero integers***, then :

$$\upsilon_p(ab) = \upsilon_p(a) + \upsilon_p(b)$$

$$a \mid b \Longleftrightarrow \upsilon_p(a)\leq \upsilon_p(b)$$

From this, it is clear that :

$$gcd(a, b) = \prod_p p^{min(v_p(a), v_p(b))}$$

<ins> **Least Common Multiple** </ins>

For $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, a ***common multiple*** of $a$ and $b$ is an integer $m$ such that $a \mid m$ and $b \mid m$. Such an $m$ is called ***least common multiple*** if :
+ $m$ is ***non-negative***
+ $m$ divides all common multiples of $a$ and $b$.

We denote the ***least common multiple*** of $a, b$ as $lcm(a, b)$

The rest material are somewhat unneccessary to omit, so I wont in to much details.

Aaaand we are done with Chapter 1 !
