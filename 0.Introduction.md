# Number Theory for Cryptography

***Number Theory*** is the foundation for cryptography in terms of mathematic  mechanisms and concepts. Therefore, I should learn a bit of number theory systematically in parallel with my study of modern cryptography.

I will be using the book ***A computational introduction to number theory and algebra (2nd edition)***, and i will use the playlist of Number theory [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqwAgBzVFVqZNMcVKpOOAA7c).

There are quite a lot of chapters and topics in this textbook that im not sure how i can omit all of them in a fixed time.

## Table of content
+ Basic properties of integers
+ Congruences
+ Computing with large integers
+ Euclid's Algorithm
+ The distribution of primes
+ Abelian group
+ Rings
+ Finite and discrete probability distribution
+ Probabilistic algorithms
+ Probabilistic primality tests
+ Finding generators and discrete logarithm in $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$
+ Quadratic reciprocity and computing modular square roots
+ Modules and vector spaces
+ Matrices
+ Linearly generated sequences and its applications
+ Finite fields
+ Algorithms on finite fields
+ Deterministic primality testings

## Methods

For each chapter, I will use the textbook to read first, then i will watch video until i understand $70\%$ of the contents. After that I will enter exercises, which i cannot guarantee to finish all of them without hints and solutions itself.

I will take notes and do exercise each chapter by Markdown files. I will probably write `Python` code or `Sagemath` code to implement if neccessary.
